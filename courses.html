            As you can see from the course list above, I am taking three classes this fall. One at Oakland Community College and two at Wayne State University.
          </p>
          <h2>MUH 1590</h2>
          <h3>Listening to Music: Rock to Hip-Hop</h3>
          <p>
            This class will be transferred over to Wayne State to count toward the DEI general education requirements. 
          </p>
          <h2>CSC 5750</h2>
          <h3>Principles of Web Technology</h3>
          <p>
            This course is part of the Information Technology major. I took Introduction to Web Technology over the summer. I work with a lot of java script for work. In our case, Dynatrace applications use it for settings, configurations, API calls and much more.
          </p>
          <h2>ACC 3010</h2>
          <h3>Introduction to Financial Accounting</h3>
          <p>
            This course is required for my business minor. Unfortunately a business minor is required but does not interest me.
